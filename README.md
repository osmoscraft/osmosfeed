## Get started

### Create a repository

1. Open [Create a new repository from osmosfeed-template](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed-template/generate).
2. Set visibility to "Public".

3. Click "Create repository from template" button.

### Turn on GitHub Pages

1. In the repository you just created, navigate to **Settings** tab > **Pages** section.
2. In **Source** option, select `gh-pages`, click "Save" button. If `gh-pages` doesn't exist, wait for a couple of seconds and refresh the page. It will eventually show up.

3. Refresh the page until it shows `Your site is published at https://<github_username>.github.io/<repo>`. This may take up to a minute.

### Customize the feed

1. In the repository root, open `osmosfeed.yaml` file, click the "Pencil (Edit this file)" button to edit.
2. Remove `# ` to uncommend the `cacheUrl` property, replace `<github_username>` with your GitHub username, and replace `<repo>` with your GitHub repo name.
3. In the sources, update the items to the sources you want to follow. The final content of the file should look similar to this:

   ```yaml
   cacheUrl: https://<github_username>.github.io/<repo>/cache.json
   timezone: America/Los_Angeles
   sources:
     - href: https://my-rss-source-1/feed/
     - href: https://my-rss-source-2/rss/
     - href: https://my-rss-source-3/feed
     - href: https://my-rss-source-4/news/rss
     - href: https://my-rss-source-5/rss/
   ```

4. Scroll to the bottom of the page, click "Commit changes" button.
5. Once the rebuild finishes, your feed will be available at `https://<github_username>.github.io/<repo>`.

## FAQ

### Can I update the content more frequently?

> Yes, you can make it as frequent as you want. In the `.github/workflows/update-feed.yaml` file, change the [cron schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule). But be aware that there is a [limit](<(https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-github-actions)>) to the free tier of GitHub Actions. My rough estimate shows that even with hourly update, you should still have plenty of unused time. You can monitor spending on [Billing & plans page in Account settings](https://github.com/settings/billing).

### Can I make the site private so only I can see it?

> It is not possible with GitHub Pages. However, if you move the site to a different hosting service, you should be able to set up authorization on the host level. For example, if you [deploy to Netlify](./docs/how-to-deploy-to-other-hosts.md#netlify), there is a paid plan for [password protection](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/).

### Do I have to type `index.html` at the end of the URL?

> No. There is a known issue with GitHub, so you might have to type it until it starts to work. See [discussion from GitHub Community](https://github.community/t/my-github-page-doesnt-redirect-to-index-html/10367/24) and [some solutions from Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45362628/github-pages-site-not-detecting-index-html)

### How to trigger a manual site update?

> You can make some changes to the `osmosfeed.yaml` file to trigger an update. For example, add an empty comment like this `# ` on a new line.

### How to reset cache?

> You can browse to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub at `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/gh-pages`. Manually delete the `cache.json` file. Then trigger a manual site update.
