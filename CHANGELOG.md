# v1.7.3

- Chore: Refactoring initialization and filesystem io
- Chore: Removed dependency `fs-extra`

# v1.7.2

- âš  Deprecated: To accommodate the monorepo setup, the node version in all templates/demos/examples has changed from 14 to 16. This is not a breaking change as our compile target is still node 14, and node 16 is backward compatible. We still recommend you start using `node-version: "16"` in your `.github/workflows/update-feed.yaml` today to get the performance/security improvements from the newer node. [See example](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-feed.yaml#L22).
- Chore: Reorganize to monorepo with npm workspace.

# v1.7.1

- Fixed: Static files were unnecessarily copied for custom templates.

# v1.7.0

- Added: Templating system. [Demo](https://osmoscraft.github.io/osmosfeed-examples/articles-unstyled/) | [Source](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed-examples/tree/main/examples/articles-unstyled) | [Docs](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed/blob/master/docs/customization-guide.md#template-customization-guide)
- Chore: Rendering logic refactoring. Adopting functional paradigm.
- Thank you @tianheg, @onnyyonn

- Added: Semantic element (`<time>`) for timestamp on the UI.
- Added: Semantic API for theming the default template.
- Changed: Moved feed metadata from article level to feed level in cache.
- Fixed: Any html-like text was stripped from title. Fixed with encoded text.

# v1.1.0

- Added: Item enrichment retry on fetch error (3 times total, 15 seconds timeout).
- Added: Console log for cache restore and update behavior.

- Changed: Improved console log that breaks down rendered item count into "new" and "cached".
- Fixed: Item enrichment timeout could crash the build.

# v1.0.0

- Changed: Runtime dependencies are moved out of devDependencies. This is not a breaking change, but to receive performance benefit, you need to make sure `@osmoscraft/osmosfeed` is listed as `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies` in the `package.json` of your rss reader site.
- Changed: Build target from node12 to node14.
- Changed: Switched to a more robust rss parser: [rss-parser](https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser)
